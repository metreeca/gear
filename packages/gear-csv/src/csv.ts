/**
 * Creates a CSV parser.
 *
 * The generated task reads CSV text and byte streams as streams of records, one {@link Record} per data row.
 *
 * Chunks are pulled from the source as records are asked for, so sources of any size are handled without holding them
 * in memory and a consumer that stops early releases the source; some chunks are nonetheless read ahead of the
 * records actually consumed, and a source reporting the whole text at once is parsed in one go.
 *
 * > [!WARNING]
 * > Records that cannot be parsed are skipped and reported to the log, leaving the stream to run to completion.
 *
 * @typeParam R The type of the reported records; field values are reported as parsed, without being validated
 *              against it
 *
 * @param options The parsing options
 * @param options.header Reads the first row as column labels, keying records by label rather than by positional
 *                       index; defaults to `false`
 * @param options.skip Ignores empty lines rather than reporting them as records; defaults to `false`
 * @param options.trim Strips surrounding whitespace from field values; defaults to `false`
 * @param options.flex Reports records whose field count doesn't match the header, leaving out missing fields and
 *                     discarding fields beyond the header, rather than skipping them; defaults to `false`
 * @param options.quote The character wrapping field values; defaults to `"` if unset or empty
 * @param options.delimiter The character separating fields; defaults to `,` if unset or empty
 *
 * @returns A task converting a stream of CSV text or byte chunks into a stream of records
 *
 * @throws Error While iterating the returned stream, whatever the source reports while producing chunks
